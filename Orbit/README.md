Prereqs
- Install Ollama and pull the model:
  - brew install ollama
  - ollama pull gemma3n:e4b
- Enable Ollama server (ollama serve). Default address http://127.0.0.1:11434

Notes and tweaks
- If bytesTask is not available in your deployment target, change stream to false in OllamaClient and use a simple dataTask; then set client.response to the final text from the returned JSON.
- You can switch to dark mode by changing background/foreground colors or using .preferredColorScheme(.dark).
- To add persistence for fieldValues, store them in @SceneStorage keyed by task and field key.
- Accent color can be set in Assets as a cyan to match your reference.

This should compile as a fresh SwiftUI Mac app and talk to your local Ollama model with a clean interface for the seven tasks.
